ü¶úüîó LangChain Essentials for Beginners: Document Q&A ProjectA comprehensive, hands-on repository for beginners diving into the world of LangChain. Learn the fundamental building blocks through clear examples and apply them immediately in a small Document Question-Answering (Q&A) project.‚ú® Project HighlightsThis repository is structured to take you from core LangChain concepts to building a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.ModuleKey Concepts CoveredProject ApplicationLLMs & PromptsLLMs (Hugging Face & OLLAMA integration), ChatModels, LangChain Prompts, ParsersGenerating answers based on retrieved document chunks.Data HandlingLoaders, Splitters, EmbeddingsUploading, processing, and chunking documents for efficient retrieval.OrchestrationChains, Primitive RunnablesCombining components (like document processing and Q&A) into a single, cohesive workflow.RetrievalRetrieverFinding the most relevant document pieces to answer a user's question.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up the project and run the examples locally.PrerequisitesPython: Version 3.9+ recommended.GitOLLAMA: You'll need to have OLLAMA installed and running to utilize the local LLM models.InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone [Your-Repo-Link-Here]
cd langchain-essentials-for-beginners

Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):Bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
Install dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Environment Variables (Optional, for HuggingFace/External Services):Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your keys (if using specific external models/services):Ini, TOML# Example for HuggingFace or a paid LLM service if you use them
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
# Other necessary keys (e.g., if you add OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)
Pull OLLAMA Models:Before running the project, pull the specific models you use (e.g., Llama 2):Bashollama pull llama2 # Or any other model used in the project

üõ†Ô∏è Key Topics ExploredEach file in the core_concepts/ directory provides a standalone example of a specific LangChain component:LLMs and ChatModels: Demonstrates the difference between the two main model interfaces and includes practical setup for Hugging Face open-source models and OLLAMA local models.Loaders and Splitters: Shows how to load different file types (PDF, TXT) and how to use various TextSplitters to handle large documents for RAG.Embeddings and Retriever: Covers generating numerical vector representations of text and setting up a basic Vector Store and Retriever for searching.Primitive Runnables and Chains: Introduces the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for creating clear, sequential, and parallel workflows.üìÑ The Document Q&A ProjectThe ultimate goal of this repository is the small project in the document_qa_project/ folder. This project combines all the learned components into a working RAG pipeline.Project DescriptionThis application allows a user to upload a document, processes it (loads, splits, embeds), and then lets the user ask questions about its content. It uses the Retriever to find relevant context, which is passed to the LLM (either Hugging Face or OLLAMA) to generate a grounded answer.How to Run the ProjectMake sure your dependencies are installed and OLLAMA is running.Execute the main project file:Bashpython document_qa_project/project_main.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to upload a document (e.g., a file from sample_documents/) and start asking questions!ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
